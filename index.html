            <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>Want to create your own portfolio? Don't know where to start?</p>
                <p>Simply enter what type of designer you are to generate a portfolio ready for customisation.</p>
                <p>A template will be created to follow along and help guide content creation for your portfolio.</p>

            <h3>Step 2</h3>
                <p>Complete the template to fill out the content side of the portfolio.</p>
                <p>This can range from short taglines to what information to include for your projects.</p>
                <p>Examples are provided to help ideation. Remember to add your personal touch to the content.</p>

            <h3>LLMs Used</h3>
                <p><a href="https://gemini.google.com/app">Gemini Advanced</a> and <a href="https://v0.dev/">v0 by Vercel</a> were used in this AI tool process.</p>
                <p>Gemini Advanced is used for language responses and checking the code generated by v0. v0 is an LLM that generates website components based on React and Tailwind CSS. The prompts used with v0 were generated by Gemini.</p>
                <p>Through an iterative process, AI responses used in the tool were graded and improved upon.</p>
                <p>On the left is the first baseline grading of the AI process.</p>

            <h3>Iteration Improvements</h3>
                <p>On the left is the final iteration grading.</p>
                <p>Gemini Advanced quickly improved in the first step of the tool with more specific prompting such as providing previous successful prompts. In the later half, I could not get it to check and change code consistently after the components were generated with v0.</p>
                <p>This AI tool process works it's just not consistent with its results.</p>
                <p>The most successful attempt was used for step 3 to give an ideal output from the process.</p>

            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Gemini Advanced not being able to process code consistently was a surprise, as it has been shown to excel at coding tasks.</p>
                <p>Designing a portfolio is quite a subjective process, v0 seems to get around this issue by providing 3 generated options to choose from and allowing iterations on the same prompt (See Image). Perhaps this process could benefit something similar to give a more tailored portfolio.</p>
                <p>The code generated by v0 is using Next.js and React which isn't as simple to use as traditional HTML and CSS. It may have been better to try and generate this traditional code, however, v0 can create complex components with very few prompt instructions.</p>
